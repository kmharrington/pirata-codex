Pirata - Codex
--------------

This will be a lightweight piece of code for tracking player activity 
levels in Clash of Clans, will include an sqlite3 database structure and 
mechanisms for running web requests to the Clash API and Discord.

Lots of things are linked to jsons in a `data/` folder, which includes 
private information. Maybe one day I'll upload examples.

I have no idea what this package will work at this point.
